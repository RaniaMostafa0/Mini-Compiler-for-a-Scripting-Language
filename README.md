Description:
This project is a Mini Compiler designed for a custom scripting language, featuring lexical analysis, syntax validation, and basic semantic checks. It tokenizes source code, builds a symbol table, generates a parse tree, and validates constructs like loops, functions, and variable declarations. Developed entirely from scratch, this project serves as a robust foundation for exploring compiler design concepts.

Features:
1) Lexical Analysis:
- Tokenizes source code into keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.
- Handles errors such as unmatched symbols, unclosed comments, and invalid tokens.
- Builds a symbol table for identifiers.
2) Syntax Analysis:
- Implements a recursive descent parser.
- Supports constructs like loops, conditions, functions, and list operations.
- Generates a parse tree for syntactic structure representation.

Usage:
1) Lexical Analysis:
- Input source code when prompted.
- Outputs tokens and a symbol table.
2) Syntax Analysis:
- Processes tokens to validate syntax.
- Generates and prints a parse tree.
